# Aikido Safe Chain - Malware Detection for Package Installation
#
# This workflow integrates Aikido Safe Chain to protect against malicious packages
# during dependency installation in CI/CD pipelines.
#
# What is Aikido Safe Chain?
# Aikido Safe Chain is a free security tool that prevents developers from installing
# malware through package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn, npx, pnpx). It wraps around
# package manager commands and verifies packages against Aikido Intel - Open Sources
# Threat Intelligence before installation. When malware is detected, it blocks the
# installation and alerts the user.
#
# Key features:
# - Free to use, no tokens required
# - Works with Node.js 18+
# - Supports npm, pnpm, yarn, npx, and pnpx
# - Currently offers limited scanning for pnpm (scans install command arguments)
# - Full dependency tree scanning support coming soon for pnpm
